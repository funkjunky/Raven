PLEASE - Don't edit the xml directly...unless you run the MapContentPipeline after.  
If you need to change parameters temporarily, I understand, but it's very confusing to try 
and figure out where something has been changed if you don't use the classes and projects that are provided, 
this requires actually reading the xml.
This also causes a problem, since nobody else knows what parameters/options you are changing, 
and when we change the maps and convert them all of your changes are lost.

------------------------------------
If you're talking about the changes I made on parameters.xml, be sure to read the history of check-ins to find exactly what files 
were changed, or read the documentation added.
If everyone updates the documentation, their should be no confusion.

Not trying to shift the blame, merely using this note as a reinforcement to update documentation.

-----------------------------------
no blame placed, it was more of a general comment. 
i rebuilt the map based on a parameter change i made and things behaved a little differently, 
that's all, just trying to make things work as smoothly as possible, 
given the massive code base and many cooks in the kitchen :)
