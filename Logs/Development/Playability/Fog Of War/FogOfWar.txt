Here's what I'm thinking.
1)  Start each bot with an empty navigation graph
2)  Start each bot with an blank empty collection of obj(health, weapon, etc.) locations
3)  As the bot 'sees' the nodes, add them to the graph
4)  As the bot 'sees' the objects, add them to collection of things to find

I added a FoundTriggersList class that is essentially a wrapper for a list of triggers.  This adds functionality 
so we can check to see how many weapons/health items etc are found.  
I decided not to add door triggers to this, since they are visible once you are close enough to see it.  
there will never be a time when a door switch is not seen...i think.

instead of finding the closest item (health, weapon) in the map triggerlist, 
it now looks through the foundtriggerlist on the bot entity, and as new ones are discovered they are added

Not sure what to do with the nodes finding yet, it's alot more difficult since graph representation is so 
intertwined...

We need to supplement something for the fog of war, because some bots look really stupid. 
Overall it's awesome, but I noticed when bots go out of range of an opponent and weapons and items, 
they look lost, slowly moving randomly. I think maybe we need to improve wander. 
Maybe have it follow the waypoint graph randomly.

The plainest problem I saw with this was when a bought was at 1hp, and just lazily wandered around, 
rather than searching the map for a health pack.

this is true, we need to improve the calculation of the desirability of exploring when we need health/ammo/have nothing better to do

I just noticed the fogofwar appears to be shorter than the range at which bots can fire at each other. 
So even though bots have the goal to explore they are firing at each other.

You may want to restrict the range of whatever AttackTarget uses to target people.

I think we are going to move the firing at an opponent into a goal aren't we?
