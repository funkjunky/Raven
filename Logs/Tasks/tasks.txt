improve graphics
improve string pulling (use with the environments)
spawn weapons in different locations
hit switches instead of attempting
change the satisfaction radii
give higher priority to switch than wall
avoid hugging (add melee attack e.g. punching/ chainsaw/ etc)
adjust window position
X - use multithreading to make faster
change priority of rail gun (recheck all other priorities)
random map generator (connected rooms)
distinct AI behaviours for bots
add controllable player
sound support
individual scores per person (frags/deaths/score) /status panel (health)
cool load screen
cloud/fog of war
game modes (capture the flag, deathmatch, etc.)
possibly change search space representation
--> no wall hugging <--


Key Components:
playability(fog of war) {Colin}
	? implement long term memory (short term exists)
	--DONE
	? not necessarily seeking closest item available
	--Seeks closest discovered item, stumbles upon additional ones

playability(AI behaviours: goal editing) {Morteza, Dan}
	? utilize bot senses to influence behaviours (hearing, vision, memory)
	? modify the ammo/health/etc. capacity so the bots don't go for the same thing repetitively
	? make changes to the desirability function based on amount of ammo held
playability(AI behaviours: group behav. & map building) {Johnny, Jason}
	? team based assistance in team versus mode (group attack formations, group rescue, etc.)
playability(AI behaviours: messaging & quick path) {Rich, Tom}
documentation {everyone update logs, vital for Goodwin to locate code changed}

Secondary Importance (1 day or less preferred)
statistics {Morteza}
	? menu system
graphics(pics/textures/load screen) {Rich}
sound {Tom, Dan}
playability(AI behaviours: capture the flag - separate map? get map builder prg)

Deprecated:
